Requirements: Ecommerce Back-Office
===================================

Vendors & Content Management
----------------------------

**Version:** 1.1 **Date:** July 20, 2025 **Status:** Draft **Context:** This document details the functional requirements for the **Ecommerce Application (`apps/ecommerce`)** outlined in the _Project Playbook v1.0_. It focuses specifically on the back-office capabilities for managing vendors and content within the publishing house's marketplace ecosystem.

1\. Vendor Management
---------------------

### 1.1. Vision & Overview

The platform will operate as a multi-vendor marketplace. Each vendor (e.g., a partner publisher, an independent author-seller) will have a dedicated, isolated environment within the back-office to manage their profile, products, and operations. A top-level Administrator will have a global view with the ability to manage and oversee all vendor activities. The system must ensure strict data segregation between vendors.

### 1.2. Vendor Registration & Profile

The system must provide a secure area for Administrators to register and manage vendors. Each vendor profile will serve as the central repository for their operational data.

**Required Vendor Fields:**

*   **Core Information:**
    
    *   `Vendor Name`: The public-facing name of the vendor.
        
    *   `Vendor ID`: A unique system identifier.
        
    *   `Logo`: An image file for branding on the front-end website.
        
    *   `Status`: (e.g., Active, Inactive, Pending Review).
        
*   **Contact & Address Information:**
    
    *   `Primary Contact`: Name, email, and phone number for the main point of contact.
        
    *   `Business Address`: The legal address of the vendor.
        
    *   `Shipping Origin Address`: The physical address from which all products from this vendor will ship. This is critical for calculating shipping costs.
        
*   **Technical & Financial Integrations:**
    
    *   `Payment Provider Configuration`: Fields to store credentials for the vendor's specific payment gateway (e.g., Stripe Connect ID, PayPal API keys).
        
    *   `Shipping Provider Configuration`: Fields to store API keys and account details for their chosen shipping provider (e.g., FedEx, UPS, local carriers).
        
*   **Logistics:**
    
    *   `Standard Box Sizes`: A configurable list of standard package dimensions (L x W x H) and weights that the vendor uses for shipping. This will inform shipping rate calculations.
        

### 1.3. Administrator-Level Vendor Dashboard

The top-level Administrator dashboard must provide a global overview of the marketplace.

**Key Features:**

*   A searchable, filterable list of all registered vendors.
    
*   At-a-glance metrics for each vendor, such as total sales, number of active products, and recent orders.
    
*   The ability to view a vendor's specific back-office dashboard as if logged in as that vendor ("impersonation") for support and oversight purposes.
    
*   Tools to approve, activate, or deactivate vendor accounts.
    

2\. Content Management
----------------------

### 2.1. Vision & Overview

"Content" is the core entity representing any item that can be sold, accessed, or downloaded through the platform. The system must be flexible enough to handle a wide variety of products from a modern publishing house, from physical books to digital course access. Each piece of Content is owned by a single Vendor.

### 2.2. Content Taxonomies

To organize the vast catalog, Content will be categorized using two primary taxonomies: **Type** and **Subject**.

#### 2.2.1. Content Types

This taxonomy defines the fundamental nature of the product. The system must support the following types, with the flexibility to add more in the future:

*   **Printed Book:** A traditional physical book.
    
*   **Ebook:** A digital version of a book (e.g., PDF, EPUB).
    
*   **Audiobook:** An audio recording of a book.
    
*   **Article:** A single piece of written work, often from a journal or magazine.
    
*   **Journal Access:** A subscription-based product granting access to issues of a specific journal for a period of time.
    
*   **Conference Proceeding:** A collection of academic papers from a conference.
    
*   **Course:** An educational product that can be delivered digitally (videos, exercises) or in-person.
    
*   **Digital Toolkit:** A collection of related digital resources, like templates, worksheets, and guides, sold as a single unit.
    
*   **Package / Bundle:** A virtual product that, when purchased, delivers multiple other Content items to the customer. For example, a "Beginner's Set" package could include a Printed Book, its Ebook version, and access to a related digital Course. The system must track inventory for each individual physical item within a bundle.
    

#### 2.2.2. Subjects

This taxonomy defines the thematic category of the content. This will be a centrally managed list of subjects (e.g., "Computer Science," "Literary Fiction," "Medical Research," "History," "Business & Finance") that can be assigned to any piece of Content.

### 2.3. Content Variables

The system must allow a single Content entry to have multiple purchasing options, or "Variables." This is essential for products with different formats or editions.

*   **Example:** A Content item named "The Art of Programming" could have the following Variables:
    
    *   Hardcover Edition ($59.99)
        
    *   Paperback Edition ($29.99)
        
    *   Signed Limited Edition Hardcover ($99.99)
        
    *   Ebook (EPUB) Version ($14.99)
        
*   Each Variable can have its own unique:
    
    *   `Price`
        
    *   `SKU` (Stock Keeping Unit)
        
    *   `Stock/Inventory Count` (for physical items)
        
    *   `Description Suffix` (e.g., "Collector's Edition with alternate cover art")
        
    *   `Images`
        
    *   `Weight` and `Dimensions` (for physical items)
        

### 2.4. Type-Specific Metadata

Different Content Types require different metadata. The content creation interface should adapt to the selected Type, showing only the relevant fields.

*   **For Books (Printed, Ebook, Audiobook):**
    
    *   `ISBN-13` / `ISBN-10`
        
    *   `Publisher`
        
    *   `Publication Date`
        
    *   `Page Count` (for print/ebook)
        
    *   `Running Time` (for audiobook)
        
    *   `Edition`
        
    *   `Language`
        
    *   `Bibliography`: A dedicated field to list bibliographical references. The system should allow linking to other Content items in the database where possible.
        
*   **For Articles / Conference Proceedings:**
    
    *   `DOI` (Digital Object Identifier)
        
    *   `Source Publication`: The name of the journal or conference.
        
    *   `Volume / Issue / Page Numbers`
        
    *   `Publication Date`
        
    *   `Abstract`
        
    *   `References`: A dedicated field to list references. The system should allow linking to other Content items in the database where possible.
        
*   **For Courses:**
    
    *   `Instructor(s)`: Link to Author entities.
        
    *   `Skill Level`: (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
        
    *   `Format`: (e.g., Video On-Demand, Live Online, In-Person)
        
    *   `Course Content`: A structured list of modules and lessons. Each lesson can be a piece of content itself (video, text, PDF download).
        

### 2.5. Access & Consumption Models

Content can be free or paid, open or restricted. The system must support the following rules on a per-Content-Variable basis:

Attribute

Options

Description

**Pricing Model**

`Paid`, `Free`

Determines if a transaction is required.

**Access Level**

`Open`, `Requires Login`

`Open` content is publicly visible. `Requires Login` content is only accessible to authenticated users, even if free.

**DRM**

`None`, `Soft DRM`

`None` means the user can download a file freely. `Soft DRM` means the content is accessible only through the platform's online reader/viewer, or a watermarked PDF is generated upon download.

### 2.6. External Links & Consumption Points

To maximize reach and provide comprehensive information, the system must allow linking a single Content item to multiple external platforms and internal consumption methods. This should be a configurable list of links.

*   **Structure of a Link:** Each entry in the list will have:
    
    *   `Platform/Label`: The display name (e.g., "Amazon Kindle", "Apple Books", "Audible", "Read Online").
        
    *   `URL`: The destination link.
        
    *   `Type`: The nature of the link (e.g., "Purchase", "Preview", "Full Access").
        
*   **Example Use Cases:**
    
    *   A book could have separate "Purchase" links for Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and a local bookstore.
        
    *   An audiobook could have "Purchase" links for both Audible and Google Play Books.
        
    *   An article might have a "Preview" link to a short excerpt and a "Full Access" link to the platform's own online reader for subscribers.
        

3\. Author Management
---------------------

### 3.1. Vision & Overview

Authors are a distinct, top-level entity within the system. They must be manageable independently from Content to create a single source of truth for author information and to link them across multiple works and even multiple vendors.

### 3.2. Author Profile

The system must have a dedicated section to create and manage author profiles.

**Required Author Fields:**

*   `Author Name`
    
*   `Biography`
    
*   `Author Photograph`
    
*   `Website / Social Media Links`
    

### 3.3. Content-Author Relationship

A robust, bi-directional link must exist between Content and Authors.

*   **Many-to-Many Relationship:** A single piece of Content can have multiple Authors. A single Author can be linked to multiple pieces of Content.
    
*   **Back-linking:** The Author profile page in the back-office must display a list of all Content linked to them. The Content editing page must allow the user to search for and assign existing Authors or create a new one.
