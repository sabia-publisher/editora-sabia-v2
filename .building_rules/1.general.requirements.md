# Project Playbook: Unified Commerce & Content Platform

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** July 19, 2025

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

This document outlines the requirements for a new, integrated web presence built on a modern, scalable architecture. The project's primary goal is to create a cohesive ecosystem of three distinct but interconnected web applications: a back-office for **Ecommerce**, a platform for **Editorial** workflows, and a public-facing **Website**.

The core vision is to build a system where data and user experience are seamlessly integrated, operational efficiency is maximized through shared resources, and a consistent brand identity is maintained across all digital touchpoints.

## 2. Guiding Principles

* **Unified Experience:** Users, whether internal staff or external customers, should experience a consistent and intuitive interface.
* **Efficiency & Scalability:** The architecture must support efficient development workflows and be capable of scaling as the business grows.
* **Maintainability:** Code and configurations should be organized logically to simplify updates, bug fixes, and future development.
* **Single Source of Truth:** Critical elements like design tokens, user permissions, and common business logic should be defined once and reused everywhere.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

To achieve our goals, the project will be structured as a **monorepo** managed by **Turborepo**. This approach allows for centralized management of dependencies, streamlined cross-application development, and simplified code sharing.

The monorepo will contain three primary applications, all built using **Nuxt 4** for its powerful features and excellent developer experience.

### Core Applications:

1.  **Ecommerce Application (`apps/ecommerce`)**
    * **Purpose:** An internal, admin-facing back-office for managing all aspects of the ecommerce operation.
    * **Target Users:** Store administrators, order fulfillment staff, customer service representatives.
    * **Contextual Needs:** Must provide a secure, efficient, and comprehensive interface for product management (inventory, pricing, details), order processing (from placement to fulfillment), and customer relationship management.

2.  **Editorial Application (`apps/editorial`)**
    * **Purpose:** A collaborative platform for creating, managing, and publishing content.
    * **Target Users:** Content writers, editors, marketing teams, and publishers.
    * **Contextual Needs:** Must support a multi-user editorial workflow, including drafts, reviews, and scheduled publishing. It should facilitate the creation of rich content (articles, blog posts, guides) that can be seamlessly displayed on the public website.

3.  **Website Application (`apps/website`)**
    * **Purpose:** The public-facing website that serves as the primary touchpoint for customers.
    * **Target Users:** The general public, potential customers, and existing customers.
    * **Contextual Needs:** Must deliver a high-performance, visually engaging, and user-friendly experience. It will be the primary consumer of the content produced in the Editorial app and the products managed in the Ecommerce app, presenting them in a unified and compelling narrative.

## 4. Shared Infrastructure & Cross-Cutting Concerns

A key benefit of the monorepo architecture is the ability to share code and configuration. The following elements will be centralized in `packages` to be consumed by the applications.

### 4.1. Authentication & Permissions

* **Centralized User Model:** A single user identity system will underpin all three applications. A user's profile and credentials will be consistent across the ecosystem.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    * Permissions will not be application-specific but will be attached to a user's profile.
    * A shared permissions file or service (`packages/auth`) will act as the single source of truth.
    * A user may have permissions to access one, multiple, or all applications. For example:
        * A *Store Manager* may only have access to the **Ecommerce** app.
        * A *Content Writer* may only have access to the **Editorial** app.
        * An *Administrator* may have access to all three applications for oversight.
    * Each application will be responsible for checking the user's permissions upon login and controlling access to its features accordingly.

### 4.2. Design System & UI

* **Shared Tailwind CSS Configuration (`packages/tailwind-config`):**
    * To ensure visual consistency, all applications will reference a single, master Tailwind CSS configuration.
    * This shared configuration will define the entire design system, including the color palette, typography (fonts, sizes, weights), spacing scale, and other design tokens.
* **Shared UI Component Library (`packages/ui`):**
    * Common UI elements (e.g., buttons, form inputs, modals, cards) will be developed as a shared library of Nuxt/Vue components.
    * This promotes code reuse, accelerates development, and guarantees that interactive elements look and behave identically across all applications.

### 4.3. Shared Logic & Utilities (`packages/shared`)

* A dedicated package will house common utilities, functions, and types that are not specific to any single application.
* Examples include:
    * API client instances or factories.
    * Data formatting functions (e.g., for dates, currency).
    * Shared data types and interfaces (e.g., `User`, `Product`, `Article`).
    * Project-wide constants.

## 5. Technology Stack Summary

* **Monorepo Manager:** Turborepo
* **Web Framework:** Nuxt 4
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Package Manager:** To be determined (pnpm is recommended for its efficiency with monorepos).

This playbook serves as the strategic foundation for the project. The next steps will involve creating a detailed technical design based on these contextual requirements.
