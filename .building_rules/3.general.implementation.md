Implementation Guide: Unified Commerce & Content Platform
=========================================================

**Version:** 1.4 **Date:** July 19, 2025

1\. Introduction üìù
-------------------

**Project Mandate: This project must be developed using Plain JavaScript only. The use of TypeScript is strictly forbidden in all applications and packages.**

This document provides a step-by-step technical implementation plan for developers. It translates the **Project Playbook** and **Technical Design Specification** into an actionable sequence of tasks. Following this guide is mandatory to ensure the final product aligns with the architectural design, maintains high quality, and is delivered efficiently. This version uses **plain JavaScript**, incorporates a **Nuxt Layer** for superior code sharing, and is optimized for **Turborepo**.

2\. Phase 1: Monorepo & Core Infrastructure Setup
-------------------------------------------------

This phase establishes the foundational structure of the entire project.

### Task 2.1: Initialize Project Repository

*   \[ \] Create the project directory (`unified-platform`) and navigate into it.
    
*   \[ \] Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
    
*   \[ \] Initialize `pnpm` at the root (`pnpm init`).
    
*   \[ \] Create the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file.
    
*   \[ \] Add the following content to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
    
        packages:
          - 'apps/*'
          - 'packages/*'
        
    

### Task 2.2: Install and Configure Turborepo

*   \[ \] Install **Turborepo** as a root-level development dependency: `pnpm add turbo --save-dev -w`.
    
*   \[ \] Create the `turbo.json` configuration file in the project root.
    
*   \[ \] Add the base pipeline configuration to `turbo.json`, optimized for Nuxt. This configuration tells Turborepo where to find the build artifacts, which is crucial for caching.
    
        {
          "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
          "globalDependencies": ["**/.env.*local"],
          "pipeline": {
            "build": {
              "dependsOn": ["^build"],
              "outputs": [".output/**", ".nuxt/**"]
            },
            "lint": {
              "dependsOn": ["^build"]
            },
            "dev": {
              "cache": false,
              "persistent": true
            }
          }
        }
        
    

### Task 2.3: Scaffold Core Packages

*   \[ \] Create the main `apps` and `packages` directories.
    
*   \[ \] Create subdirectories for the core packages: `packages/layer`, `packages/tailwind-config`, `packages/zod-schemas`, and `packages/firebase-config`.
    

### **Checkpoint 1: Core Structure ‚úÖ**

*   \[ \] The root directory contains `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and `turbo.json`.
    
*   \[ \] The `apps/` and `packages/` directories exist with all required subdirectories.
    
*   \[ \] Running `pnpm install` in the root completes without errors.
    

3\. Phase 2: Application Scaffolding & Integration
--------------------------------------------------

This phase creates the three Nuxt applications and wires them into the monorepo.

### Task 3.1: Initialize Nuxt Applications

*   \[ \] Create the Ecommerce app: `npx nuxi@latest init apps/ecommerce`.
    
*   \[ \] Create the Editorial app: `npx nuxi@latest init apps/editorial`.
    
*   \[ \] Create the Website app: `npx nuxi@latest init apps/website`.
    

### Task 3.2: Configure JavaScript for Workspace Paths

*   \[ \] Create a root `jsconfig.json` file to enable path aliases for the workspace.
    
*   \[ \] Add the `paths` alias for `@repo/*` to the root `jsconfig.json`:
    
        {
          "compilerOptions": {
            "paths": {
              "@repo/*": ["./packages/*"]
            }
          }
        }
        
    

### **Checkpoint 2: Applications Running ‚úÖ**

*   \[ \] The `apps` directory contains three fully scaffolded Nuxt projects.
    
*   \[ \] `pnpm install` from the root installs all dependencies for all apps.
    
*   \[ \] `turbo dev` successfully starts all three development servers.
    
*   \[ \] Each application is accessible in the browser at its designated port.
    

4\. Phase 3: Firebase Integration
---------------------------------

This phase connects the monorepo to the Firebase backend and hosting infrastructure.

### Task 4.1: Set Up Firebase Project

*   \[ \] Create a new project in the Firebase Console.
    
*   \[ \] Enable **Authentication** (with Email/Password provider).
    
*   \[ \] Enable **Cloud Firestore**.
    
*   \[ \] Enable **Firebase Hosting**.
    

### Task 4.2: Configure Firebase CLI & Hosting

*   \[ \] Install the Firebase CLI globally: `pnpm add firebase-tools -g`.
    
*   \[ \] Log in to your Google account: `firebase login`.
    
*   \[ \] Initialize Firebase in the project root: `firebase init`. (Select your project and **do not overwrite** existing files).
    
*   \[ \] Configure `firebase.json` for multi-site hosting as specified in the design document.
    
*   \[ \] Apply the hosting targets to your sites in the Firebase console:
    
    *   \[ \] `firebase target:apply hosting ecommerce <your-ecommerce-site-name>`
        
    *   \[ \] `firebase target:apply hosting editorial <your-editorial-site-name>`
        
    *   \[ \] `firebase target:apply hosting website <your-website-site-name>`
        

### **Checkpoint 3: Initial Deployment ‚úÖ**

*   \[ \] `firebase.json` is configured for three hosting targets.
    
*   \[ \] `turbo build` successfully builds all three Nuxt applications.
    
*   \[ \] A targeted deploy command works, e.g., `firebase deploy --only hosting:website`.
    
*   \[ \] The blank starter Nuxt app is live on its production domain.
    

5\. Phase 4: Building the Shared Nuxt Layer
-------------------------------------------

This phase creates the central Nuxt Layer that will provide all shared components, composables, and configurations to the applications.

### Task 5.1: Initialize the Layer Package

*   \[ \] In `packages/layer`, create a `package.json` file and add a name, e.g., `"name": "@repo/layer"`.
    
*   \[ \] Create the standard Nuxt directory structure inside `packages/layer`: `components`, `composables`, `plugins`, `utils`, `middleware`.
    
*   \[ \] Create a `nuxt.config.js` file in `packages/layer`. This file will configure all shared modules.
    

### Task 5.2: Integrate Shared Tailwind Config into the Layer

*   \[ \] In `packages/tailwind-config`, create a `tailwind.config.js` file that exports your base theme.
    
*   \[ \] In `packages/layer`, install the `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` module.
    
*   \[ \] In `packages/layer/nuxt.config.js`, configure the module to use the shared config:
    
        import sharedConfig from '@repo/tailwind-config'
        
        export default {
          modules: ['@nuxtjs/tailwindcss'],
          tailwindcss: {
            // Use the shared config as the base
            config: sharedConfig
          }
        }
        
    

### Task 5.3: Populate the Layer with Shared Code

*   \[ \] **Components:** Create shared Vue components (e.g., `Button.vue`, `Card.vue`) inside `packages/layer/components/`. They will be auto-imported by the apps.
    
*   \[ \] **Zod Schemas:** In `packages/zod-schemas`, install Zod (`pnpm add zod`) and define your schemas (e.g., `user.js`).
    
*   \[ \] **Utilities:** Create utility functions (e.g., for date formatting) in `packages/layer/utils/`. Import Zod schemas here as needed for validation helpers.
    
*   \[ \] **Composables:** Create shared composables (e.g., `useAuthUser.js`) in `packages/layer/composables/`.
    
*   \[ \] **Plugins:** Create plugins (e.g., for Firebase initialization) in `packages/layer/plugins/`.
    

### Task 5.4: Configure Applications to Use the Layer

*   \[ \] In each application (`apps/ecommerce`, `apps/editorial`, `apps/website`), modify the `nuxt.config.js` to extend the shared layer. The file should be simplified to this:
    
        export default {
          extends: [
            '@repo/layer'
          ]
        }
        
    

### **Checkpoint 4: Shared Layer Consumption ‚úÖ**

*   \[ \] Each app's `nuxt.config.js` is simplified to only extend the `@repo/layer`.
    
*   \[ \] A `<Button />` component from `packages/layer/components` renders correctly in the `ecommerce` app without any manual imports.
    
*   \[ \] The button has the correct styling, proving the Tailwind CSS configuration from the layer is being applied.
    
*   \[ \] A utility function from `packages/layer/utils` can be used in the `website` app.
    

6\. Phase 5: Authentication & Authorization
-------------------------------------------

This phase implements the user access control system _within the shared layer_.

### Task 6.1: Implement Auth Logic in the Layer

*   \[ \] In `packages/layer/plugins/`, create the Firebase initialization plugin (e.g., `firebase.client.js`).
    
*   \[ \] In `packages/layer/composables/`, create the `useAuthUser.js` composable that provides reactive access to the user's state and Firestore permissions.
    
*   \[ \] In `packages/layer/server/utils/`, create server-side utilities for verifying Firebase ID tokens.
    

### Task 6.2: Implement Route Protection in the Layer

*   \[ \] In `packages/layer/middleware/`, create a middleware file, e.g., `auth.js`.
    
*   \[ \] This middleware should check for a user's authentication status and permissions. It can be configured on a per-page basis.
    
*   \[ \] **Example Usage (in `apps/ecommerce/pages/admin.vue`):**
    
        definePageMeta({
          middleware: 'auth',
          // Custom metadata to be checked by the middleware
          requiredPermission: 'canAccessEcommerce'
        });
        
    

### **Checkpoint 5: Secure Access Control ‚úÖ**

*   \[ \] A user can sign up and sign in.
    
*   \[ \] A corresponding user document is created in Firestore with default permissions.
    
*   \[ \] An unprivileged user trying to access a protected route is correctly redirected by the shared middleware.
    
*   \[ \] After manually elevating a user's permissions in Firestore, they can access the protected route.
    

7\. Phase 6: Development Workflow & Rules üßë‚Äçüíª
-----------------------------------------------

Adherence to these rules is non-negotiable to maintain code quality and a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.

### Branching Strategy

*   \[ \] All development occurs on feature branches created from `main`.
    
*   \[ \] Branch names follow the `[type]/[description]` convention (e.g., `feature/ecommerce-product-page`).
    

### Commit Messages

*   \[ \] All commit messages follow the **Conventional Commits** specification.
    
*   \[ \] The format is `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
    

### Pull Requests (PRs)

*   \[ \] All feature branches are merged into `main` via a Pull Request.
    
*   \[ \] PRs require at least one code review.
    
*   \[ \] PRs must pass all automated CI checks before merging.
    

### CI/CD Pipeline

*   \[ \] The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is the sole method for deployment.
    
*   \[ \] Pushing to `main` automatically triggers the build and deploy process for affected apps only.
    
*   \[ \] Manual deployments are forbidden.
