Technical Design Specification: Unified Commerce & Content Platform
===================================================================

**Version:** 1.0 **Date:** July 19, 2025 **Author:** Gemini

1\. Introduction
----------------

This document provides a detailed technical design for the Unified Commerce & Content Platform, building upon the foundational requirements outlined in the **Project Playbook v1.0**. The primary objective of this specification is to define the core architecture, technology stack, and development patterns that will be used to build, maintain, and deploy the `ecommerce`, `editorial`, and `website` applications.

The design prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and developer efficiency by leveraging a Turborepo monorepo, Nuxt 4, and the Firebase ecosystem.

2\. Core Architecture & Monorepo Structure
------------------------------------------

The project will be structured as a monorepo managed by **Turborepo**. This approach is fundamental to achieving the project's goals of code sharing and operational efficiency. Turborepo will manage the build pipeline, local development servers, and ensure that tasks are executed efficiently through caching and parallelization.

### 2.1. Directory Structure

The monorepo will have a clear separation between applications (`apps`) and shared code (`packages`). The recommended package manager is **pnpm** due to its efficient handling of dependencies in a monorepo environment.

    │   ├── ecommerce/      # Nuxt App: Back-office for store management
    │   │   ├── nuxt.config.ts

    │   ├── auth/           # Authentication logic, middleware, and helpers

    │
    ├── .github/
    │   └── workflows/
    │       └── deploy.yml  # CI/CD pipeline for GitHub Actions
    │
    ├── firebase.json       # Firebase project configuration (hosting, functions)
    ├── turbo.json          # Turborepo pipeline configuration
    ├── package.json        # Root package configuration
    └── pnpm-workspace.yaml # pnpm workspace definition
    

### 2.2. Turborepo Configuration (`turbo.json`)

The `turbo.json` file will define the dependency graph and task pipeline for the monorepo. This allows Turborepo to understand which tasks depend on others (e.g., an app's `build` depends on the `ui` package's `build`). It will cache outputs to avoid re-running tasks on unchanged code, which is critical for fast CI/CD builds.

3\. Application & Hosting Architecture
--------------------------------------

The three core applications will be built with **Nuxt 4** and hosted on **Firebase Hosting**.

### 3.1. Nuxt 4 Applications

Each application in the `apps/` directory will be a standalone Nuxt 4 project. The choice of Nuxt 4 provides a robust framework with server-side rendering (SSR), which is essential for the public `website`'s SEO performance and provides a dynamic, secure environment for the `ecommerce` and `editorial` back-office applications.

### 3.2. Firebase Hosting & Domain Strategy

**Firebase Hosting's multi-site feature** will be used to deploy each application to its designated domain from a single Firebase project. This centralizes hosting management while maintaining separate domains.

*   **Website:** Deployed to the default site, connected to the root domain (`yourdomain.com`).
    
*   **Ecommerce:** Deployed to a dedicated site target (`ecommerce`), connected to a subdomain (`ecommerce.yourdomain.com`).
    
*   **Editorial:** Deployed to a dedicated site target (`editorial`), connected to a subdomain (`editorial.yourdomain.com`).
    

The root `firebase.json` file will manage this configuration:

    {
      "hosting": [
        {
          "target": "website",
          "public": "apps/website/.output/public",
          "rewrites": [{ "source": "**", "function": "server" }]
        },
        {
          "target": "ecommerce",
          "public": "apps/ecommerce/.output/public",
          "rewrites": [{ "source": "**", "function": "server" }]
        },
        {
          "target": "editorial",
          "public": "apps/editorial/.output/public",
          "rewrites": [{ "source": "**", "function": "server" }]
        }
      ]
    }
    

_Note: The rewrite to a cloud function (`server`) is standard for hosting Nuxt SSR applications on Firebase._

4\. Data Architecture & Management
----------------------------------

**Cloud Firestore** will serve as the primary database for all applications. A single Firestore instance will be shared across the ecosystem, with data access controlled by security rules.

### 4.1. Data Validation (`packages/zod-schemas`)

To ensure data integrity and provide a single source of truth for data structures, a dedicated package, `packages/zod-schemas`, will be created. This package will use **Zod** to define and export schemas for all Firestore collections.

*   **Purpose:** Enforce consistent data shapes for writes and reads across all three applications.
    
*   **Usage:** Each application will import these schemas to validate form inputs, API responses, and data before it is sent to Firestore.
    
*   **Example (`packages/zod-schemas/user.ts`):**
    
        import { z } from 'zod';
        
        export const UserPermissionsSchema = z.object({
          canAccessEcommerce: z.boolean().default(false),
          canAccessEditorial: z.boolean().default(false),
          canPublishContent: z.boolean().default(false),
          isSuperAdmin: z.boolean().default(false),
        });
        
        export const UserSchema = z.object({
          uid: z.string(),
          email: z.string().email(),
          displayName: z.string(),
          photoURL: z.string().url().optional(),
          permissions: UserPermissionsSchema,
        });
        
    

### 4.2. Firestore Collections

The following collections will be established. Their access will be governed by rules defined in `packages/firebase-config/firestore.rules`.

*   `users`: Stores user profiles and application-specific permissions. The document ID will be the Firebase Auth `uid`.
    
*   `contents`: For all editorial content (articles, guides). Will include fields for status (draft, review, published), author references, and content body.
    
*   `orders`: All ecommerce order information, linked to a user and products.
    
*   `coupons`: Discount codes and their rules for the ecommerce application.
    
*   `editorial_flow`: Configuration documents that define the steps and roles in the content publishing workflow (e.g., 'Draft' -> 'Review' -> 'Approved').
    
*   `settings`: General settings for each application, such as payment provider API keys, shipping configurations, and SMTP details. Documents can be keyed by application name (e.g., `ecommerce_settings`).
    
*   `emails`: Templates for transactional emails (e.g., order confirmation, password reset).
    
*   `contacts`: A collection for storing contact form submissions or CRM data.
    
*   `pages`: For creating dynamic, content-managed pages that can appear on any of the websites, particularly the public one.
    

### 4.3. Firebase Configuration (`packages/firebase-config`)

This package will centralize all Firebase-related configuration files, ensuring consistency.

*   `firestore.rules`: A single set of security rules for all applications. Rules will be granular, checking a user's `permissions` field within their `/users/{uid}` document to grant read/write access to different collections.
    
*   `firestore.indexes.json`: Composite index definitions for Firestore.
    
*   `storage.rules`: Security rules for Cloud Storage, if used for file uploads.
    

5\. Shared Infrastructure Packages
----------------------------------

The `packages/` directory is key to enforcing the "single source of truth" principle.

*   **`packages/ui`**: Will contain a library of shared, unstyled UI components built with Nuxt/Vue (e.g., `BaseButton.vue`, `FormInput.vue`). These components will be styled via the shared Tailwind configuration.
    
*   **`packages/tailwind-config`**: Will export a single, master Tailwind CSS configuration object. Each application's `tailwind.config.js` will import and extend this base configuration, ensuring a consistent design system (colors, fonts, spacing) across the entire platform.
    
*   **`packages/auth`**: This package will house shared authentication logic. This includes Nuxt middleware for route protection, helper functions to interact with Firebase Auth, and composables for accessing the current user's state and permissions.
    
*   **`packages/shared`**: A general-purpose package for any code that can be reused, such as date formatting functions, currency utilities, shared TypeScript interfaces (derived from Zod schemas), and API client factories.
    

6\. Authentication & Authorization
----------------------------------

*   **Authentication:** Will be handled by **Firebase Authentication**. This provides a secure, managed service for user sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
    
*   **Authorization:** Will be based on a custom permissions model stored directly on each user's document in the `users` collection. This avoids a rigid role-based system and allows for granular, per-user access control.
    
    *   **Flow:**
        
        1.  A user authenticates via Firebase Auth.
            
        2.  A global Nuxt plugin or middleware fetches the corresponding `/users/{uid}` document from Firestore.
            
        3.  The user's profile and their `permissions` object are stored in a global state (e.g., using Pinia).
            
        4.  Nuxt middleware in each application will protect routes by checking the required permission from the user's state (e.g., `if (!user.permissions.canAccessEcommerce) { return navigateTo('/unauthorized'); }`).
            

7\. CI/CD & Deployment Strategy
-------------------------------

A single CI/CD pipeline will be configured in **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to handle testing, building, and deploying the applications.

*   **Environment:** The pipeline will target a single **production** environment.
    
*   **Granular Deploys:** The workflow will leverage Turborepo's remote caching and affected-package detection (`--filter="...[HEAD^1]"`).
    
    *   On a push to the `main` branch, the workflow will determine which applications (`ecommerce`, `editorial`, `website`) have been affected by the changes.
        
    *   It will then run the build process only for the affected applications.
        
    *   Finally, it will execute a targeted Firebase deploy command for each changed application (e.g., `firebase deploy --only hosting:ecommerce`). This prevents unnecessary builds and deployments, saving time and resources.
